### Motivation

A critical problem in using longitudinal wearable sensor data for digital biomarker development is the "data deluge" and subsequent immense data storage costs. Here, we examine data compression methods and evaluate them on common wearable sensor data. We highly encourage you to contribute and test your own data compression method to continue this effort!

### Dependencies
Varies by compression algorithm, see specific READMEs

### Instructions

Each module is function-based in Python. Please visit each module for specific instructions. 


### Methods
* Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with Huffman encoding
* Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with Run-length encoding
* Singluar Value Decomposition with Huffman encoding
* Direct Huffman encoding
* Discrete Wavelet Transfrom (bio-orthogonal) with Huffman encoding


### Issues

Please open a new "Issue", describe your problem, and tag the package author in the Issue.
